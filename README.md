# SIMULATION
Simulation of SBI- IIT(BHU) banking system
Here my objective was to reduce the average waiting of the customers waiting in the queue to 5 minutes.
I collected the data regarding the inter arrival rate of the customers and the service rate of of the SBI employee.
I ploted a histogram to see which distribution my data follows.
I used chi -square test to determine the best fit curve.
Then I contructed an ARENA model for simulation to verify my result.
I used T statistic alpha test and then performed beta testing.
